# waterfix
A Wurm Unlimited mod that allows building structures, plating trees, hedges, etc. at dirt level 0. Also allows planting hedges on the north/east borders of tiles that are otherwise underwater.

## Building
Requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and, obviously, a JDK.

Run `mvn compile jar:jar assembly:single` to build the distribution zip. You can find it under the newly created `target/` directory.
